             <img src="img/dogs/beagle7.jpg" alt="" id="beagle" hspace="20" width="600px">
             <p> <font size="3"><br><br> If you have recently adopted a beagle you should know that you have gained a faithful, affectionate, active and energetic companion. If you have a spacious home and time to provide your dog with all the exercise they need,
                congratulations, you've found your ideal dog! The specific care that beagles require includes: weekly brushing, exercise and food control. Why? Very simple, this is a dog with an insatiable appetite. They could eat a whole bowl
                of dog food in a single sitting! Unfortunately, this can lead to obesity that, as a result, could lead to serious health problems. Her at AnimalWised, we have all the info you need to know how much food a beagle needs. We will
                be discussing a beagle's diet and looking at a beagle feeding guide to help you!

        <h1 class="hunain">How to properly feed a beagle?</h1>
        <img src="img/dogs/beagle3.jpg" alt="" id="beagle" hspace="20">
        <p><font size="3"> Each breed of dog has particular characteristics that help us decide on their nutritional or other needs. Although all beagles require a great supply of protein. As well as the composition of the food, the amount we provide will also
                depend on the breed and the following factors: Age Adult weight Physical activity It is obvious that a beagle puppy in its early stages will not consume the same amount of food as an adult or elderly beagle. In the same way, small,
                medium, large and giant canines are also assigned quantities suited to their size. With this said, when determining how much food our beagle should eat, we will focus primarily on how much physical activity they practice. Beagles
                require long walks and exercise that manage to burn all their accumulated energy. Likewise, this very energetic nature results in them having an insatiable appetite. Controlling food portions can become a task for owners but is
                very important. Beagles, as we have mentioned before, have a greater tendency of become obese than other dog breeds, and therefore, their diets need to be controlled meticulously.</font>

        <h1 class="hunain">How much should a beagle puppy eat?</h1>
        <img src="img/dogs/beagle5.jpg" alt="" id="beagle" hspace="20">
        <p><font size="3">During the puppy stage, our beagle needs many grams of food. Therefore, it is not surprising that we give them more during the first months, compared to when they reach adulthood. In this sense, it is considered that the beagle has
                reached maturity once they surpass 12 months of life. Until then, we will have to buy dry feed from the junior range, manufactured exclusively to meet the needs of this breed of dog. The selected feed should contain a high percentage
                of proteins and nutrients. These will support their digestive system and ensure the correct development of their intestinal (or gut) flora. Also, it is important that essential minerals, like calcium and phosphorus are found in
                the composition. These minerals help the proper formation of your pup's skeleton and prevent problems with their joints. As they are active and energetic animals, they often suffer from diseases related to bones and joints. Keeping
                them in perfect condition from birth is fundamental to prevent these diseases. Finally, note that the feed contains antioxidants to help strengthen their immune system. We advise you to look for quality feed to provide your puppy
                with the best nutrition. Keep in mind that this is the most important stage of their life. This marks their evolution and development. So, you should avoid those brands that are predominantly flour and cereals. When you feed your
                beagle puppy, you must take into account the following considerations: To encourage feed intake during the first two months, it is advisable to moisten it in water to soften it. Then you will have to decrease the amount of water
                until the feed is completely dry. From 2 to 4 months we will ration the daily grams and we will give them in four shots. From 4 to 6, we will give them in three. At 6 months, we can now give them the daily total number of grams
                divided into two meals. Below you will find a beagle feeding guide presenting you with the total amount of grams you should feed your beagle a day. The figures take into consideration how old they are and the weight they will reach
                as an adult. In order to know the present and future weight of your beagle , you should consult your vet. You will observe that up to 6 months, the daily food amount fro your beagle will increase to cover all of its nutritional
                needs. From 6 months onward, you should reduce their food intake to avoid excessive weight gain and/or obesity.
